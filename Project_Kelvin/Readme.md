#### Project Description
By combining subjective value metrics (eigenkarma) with objective metrics (monte carlo), we identify the actual best regenerative projects and fund them using our recursive bonding curve token economic model.

#### Summary
Allows users to create proposals, vote on proposals (using the Time/Temperature/Capital model from the 0 Degree Project) , fund proposals, and then get rewarded for creating, predicting, and enacting the highest impact proposals for regenerative projects.

#### Next Steps
What do you need to do next to turn this prototype into a working solution?

To finish we need to:
1. Add authentication to our API
2. PRovide ways to buy into our recursive bonding cuve from the UI
3. Make our oracle solution more robust.
